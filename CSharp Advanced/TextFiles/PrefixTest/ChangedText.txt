Now is the  of start discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And start the clouds that lour'd upon  house
In the  start of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised  hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry start,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war start smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright  souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a .
But I, start am  shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely start and want love's majesty
To strut  a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
