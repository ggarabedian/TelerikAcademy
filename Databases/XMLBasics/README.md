# XML Basics

### XML
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language used to encode documents in a format readable by both humans and machines.

### XML namespace
A namespace name is a uniform resource identifier (URI). Typically, the URI chosen for the namespace of a given XML vocabulary describes a resource under the control of the author or organization. However, the namespace specification does not require nor suggest that the namespace URI be used to retrieve information; it is simply treated by an XML parser as a string. The namespaces in an XML document are used  for providing uniquely named elements and attributes.

### URI
The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify the name of a resource. Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols.
