Now is the winter of our discontent
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
